    In this lab, you'll build a CNN from scratch to:

    - classify the main subject in an image
    localize it by drawing bounding boxes around it.
    You'll use the MNIST dataset to synthesize a custom dataset for the task:

    - Place each "digit" image on a black canvas of width 75 x 75 at random locations.
    Calculate the corresponding bounding boxes for those "digits".
    The bounding box prediction can be modelled as a "regression" task, which means that the model will predict a numeric value (as opposed to a category)

    - Calculate the IOU (Intersection Over Union) metric to evaluate the model's performance
